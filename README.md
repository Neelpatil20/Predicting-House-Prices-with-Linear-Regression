# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Linear-Regression
📈 Project 1: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
Oasis Infobyte Internship – Data Analytics

📌 Project Overview
This project uses Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various numerical features. It's a classic example of supervised machine learning where the goal is to model the relationship between input variables and a continuous target variable (price).

🧠 Key Concepts & Challenges
Data Collection: Use a dataset with numerical predictors (e.g., area, number of rooms, location).

Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze variable distributions, correlations, and handle missing values.

Feature Selection: Choose features that most significantly affect price.

Model Training: Apply Linear Regression using Scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics like R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Visualization: Plot actual vs predicted values, residual plots, and feature impact.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Grasp the working of Linear Regression.

Gain hands-on experience in building and evaluating a predictive model.

Learn to interpret model coefficients and diagnose errors.

📁 Tools Used
